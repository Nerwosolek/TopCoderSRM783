#The Top Coder SRM 783 solutions

Here is my attempt to solve Top Coder's Single Round Match number 783.
You can find what problems were included in the match here: [Match 783](https://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=round_overview&rd=17903)
But to see the problem's statement you should go into the [Arena](https://arena.topcoder.com) and click: _Practice Problems_ icon.

For this match there are available [editorials](https://www.topcoder.com/single-round-match-783-editorials/) where you can find solutions written by professional Top Coders.
What I am trying to achieve here is to find my own solutions and afterwards analyze them and compare to the professional ones.
